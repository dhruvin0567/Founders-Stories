      "rendered": "<p><strong>This week, Manan Shah and I had the privilege of sitting down with Sagar Patel</strong>,</p>\n<p>A humble visionary who turned a $7 freelancing gig into a thriving WordPress powerhouse.</p>\n<p>In a small village near Ahmedabad, a boy without a computer dreamed of building tools that would power websites around the world.</p>\n<p>His parents never finished school. He saved lunch money to browse the internet from cyber caf\u00e9s. His first online profit? $7.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, that dreamer is none other than the founder of Posimyth Innovations, Sagar Patel.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the story of how humble beginnings, curiosity, and quiet conviction built something remarkable.</p>\n<div>\n<hr />\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">From Village Life to the Digital World</h2>\n<p>Sagar was born in\u00a0<strong>Naroda</strong>, a village near Ahmedabad. His father was a\u00a0<strong>milkman and farmer</strong>. His parents never completed schooling.</p>\n<p>Despite limited resources, Sagar\u2019s natural curiosity and love for philosophy shaped his early thinking. He excelled in school but saw his college grades dip, Not from lack of effort, but from exploring beyond the classroom.</p>\n<p>He studied\u00a0<strong>Computer Science (B.E.) at Gujarat Technological University (2010\u20132013)</strong>, and didn\u2019t own a personal computer until his third year. Instead, he relied on cyber caf\u00e9s and his college library to chase his fascination with the digital world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re hungry to learn, you find a way. No matter where you are.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<hr />\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">The $7 That Started It All</h2>\n<p>In his\u00a0<strong>7th semester</strong>, Sagar began freelancing, doing small projects late at night. Along with his friend\u00a0<strong>Rushi Patel</strong>, he co-founded\u00a0<strong>INSIGNIA Technolabs</strong>\u00a0in 2013.</p>\n<p>He spent nights sending proposals on platforms like Upwork and Freelancer.com</p>\n<p>His first earnings?\u00a0<strong>$7</strong>. Not just a number, A turning point.</p>\n<div>\n<hr />\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Discovering the Problem in WordPress</h2>\n<p>As he built websites, Sagar encountered WordPress and saw both its promise and its pain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performance issues</li>\n<li>Limited design flexibility</li>\n<li>Friction for non-technical users</li>\n<li>Bloated tools that made simple tasks harder</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most plugins didn\u2019t solve real problems. They added noise, not clarity.</p>\n<p>This insight sparked something deeper, A vision to build what creators truly needed.</p>\n<div>\n<hr />\n</div>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<picture><source srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png 1456w\" type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"100vw\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"sizing-normal aligncenter\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png\" sizes=\"auto, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HJU3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png 1456w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1026\" height=\"577\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2343018,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://niraj12.substack.com/i/166303670?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ead6955-eb39-4ce7-a3dc-adeb2457513b_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" /></picture>\n<div class=\"image-link-expand\">\n<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\">\n<div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Launching Posimyth, On a Date That Meant More</h2>\n<p>On\u00a0<strong>20th July 2015</strong>, the anniversary of humankind\u2019s first step on the moon, Sagar launched\u00a0<strong>Posimyth Innovations</strong>.</p>\n<p>His mission was clear:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cEmpower creators to build better websites without struggling with complex tools.\u201d</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The first product?\u00a0<strong>The Plus Addons for Elementor</strong>, A performance-first, user-friendly toolkit that extended Elementor\u2019s potential in powerful new ways.</p>\n<div>\n<hr />\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Building With Users in Mind</h2>\n<p>Instead of competing on features, Sagar focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solving real problems</li>\n<li>Clean design systems</li>\n<li>Performance optimization</li>\n<li>Thoughtful onboarding</li>\n<li>Human support and documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result?

Nobody\u2014not even professors or peers\u2014imagined he\u2019d one day lead a multi-crore business that\u2019s shaping the future of renewable energy in Gujarat.</p>\n<p>But behind those quiet classrooms sat a young man with fire in his gut.</p>\n<p>A fire to do something meaningful. To build something that <em>mattered.</em></p>\n<h2>Betting on Solar, Not on Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>After college, while others rushed to land stable jobs, Mehul made a choice that changed everything.</p>\n<p>He saw the rising need \u2014 and broken trust \u2014 in India\u2019s solar energy market. Especially in Gujarat, a state blessed with sunlight but underserved by reliable solutions.</p>\n<p>And so, with <strong>no funding, no big brand name, and no safety net</strong>, Mehul started <strong>Say Solar</strong> \u2014 a venture rooted in <strong>trust, transparency, and technology</strong>.</p>\n<p>His goal?<br />\n<strong>To make solar energy accessible and trustworthy for every household.</strong></p>\n<p>Not just installations. But education, service, and long-term support.</p>\n<h2>Numbers That Tell a Deeper Story</h2>\n<p>Fast forward to 2025, and Say Solar isn\u2019t just growing \u2014 it\u2019s thriving.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<strong>5000+ solar rooftop installations</strong> across Gujarat</li>\n<li><strong>\u20b922 Crore turnover</strong> in FY 2024\u201325</li>\n<li>\u00a0Fully automated <strong>CRM &amp; operations with Zoho</strong></li>\n<li>\u00a0A <strong>scalable dealer network</strong> expanding rapidly</li>\n<li>\u00a0Bold mission: <strong>Solarizing 1,00,000 homes by 2030</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These numbers are impressive, but what stands out more is the philosophy Mehul operates with.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t talk like a salesperson.<br />\nHe speaks like a <strong>system builder</strong>, an <strong>educator</strong>, a <strong>visionary</strong> who knows the impact of every solar panel he installs.</p>\n<h2>The Mindset Shift: From Marks to Mission</h2>\n<p>The most inspiring part?</p>\n<p>Mehul never blames his past.<br />\nNever hides his low scores.<br />\nNever denies the tough start.</p>\n<p>Instead, he embraces it because it shaped him.<br />\nHis story is a living example of something we all need to hear more often:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Your marks don\u2019t define your mindset.<br />\nYour failures don\u2019t define your future.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>We\u2019re conditioned to believe success comes to toppers, those who tick every box.<br />\nBut Mehul proves it\u2019s <strong>effort</strong>, <strong>resilience</strong>, and <strong>systems thinking</strong> that win the long game.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Final Thoughts: A Gujarati Entrepreneur Who\u2019s Leading with Grit</h2>\n<p>As someone who\u2019s known Mehul from the \u201cbackbencher days,\u201d I couldn\u2019t be more proud.</p>\n<p>He represents a new kind of founder \u2014 not chasing vanity metrics, not flashing investor decks, but <strong>building quietly and boldly</strong>, with purpose at the center.</p>\n<p>And if there\u2019s one thing to take away from his journey, it\u2019s this:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Being average on paper means nothing<br />\nwhen you&#8217;re extraordinary in effort.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Here\u2019s to more stories like this \u2014 of real founders, real impact, and the quiet revolutions happening in small towns and sunny rooftops across India.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<p>This week, <strong>Manan Shah</strong> and I had the privilege of sitting down with someone I\u2019ve admired for over 15 years \u2014 <strong>Harshal Trivedi</strong>, the visionary founder of <strong>Tusker AI</strong> and the driving force behind <strong>Softvan Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, now part of the <strong>Sahana System Group</strong>.</p>\n<p>What began as a casual coffee conversation turned into a deep dive into tech, mindset, research, and leadership \u2014 essentially, a <strong>masterclass in fearless entrepreneurship</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>\u00a0About the Founder: A Rare Blend of Vision and Discipline</h2>\n<p>Harshal Sir is far from your typical tech founder.</p>\n<p>While most struggle to balance one venture, he:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leads a <strong>150+ member software agency</strong>, Softvan Pvt. Ltd.</li>\n<li>Built <strong>Tusker AI</strong>, a powerful <strong>no-code computer vision platform</strong></li>\n<li>Is currently pursuing a <strong>PhD at Nirma University</strong> \u2014 yes, you read that right.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This mix of execution, education, and evolution is rare \u2014 and exactly what made this conversation unforgettable.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>\u00a0What We Discussed: Learnings from a Deep-Tech Trailblazer</h2>\n<h3>1. <strong>Executing a Startup Idea the Right Way</strong></h3>\n<p>Harshal emphasized that launching a tech product is <strong>not just about building</strong>, but about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Validating your idea through <strong>surveys and feedback</strong></li>\n<li>Selecting the <strong>right tech stack</strong> with scalability in mind</li>\n<li>Always anchoring innovation in <strong>real-world problems</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with code. Start with clarity.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<h3>2. <strong>The Mindset of Rapid Tech Adoption</strong></h3>\n<p>Tusker AI thrives in a fast-moving ecosystem \u2014 from computer vision to no-code innovation \u2014 but Harshal makes it clear:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cSpeed isn\u2019t about being first. It\u2019s about learning faster than anyone else.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>He explained how his team constantly <strong>experiments, adapts, and delivers</strong>, helping global clients with cutting-edge yet stable solutions.</p>\n<h3>3. <strong>The Role of Networking in Mindset Shaping</strong></h3>\n<p>What sets Harshal apart is not just <em>what</em> he builds, but <em>how</em> he connects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He actively mentors other founders</li>\n<li>He\u2019s constantly attending academic and industry events</li>\n<li>And he believes networking is not for funding \u2014 it\u2019s for learning</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cSurround yourself with people who\u2019ve already walked the path you\u2019re starting on.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<h3>4. <strong>Thinking Outside the Box</strong></h3>\n<p>Harshal shared multiple examples of how unconventional thinking led to practical breakthroughs. One that stuck with us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe answers to tech problems are rarely in tech \u2014 they\u2019re in how people use it.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s deploying AI in agriculture or healthcare, Tusker AI is built not just for accuracy, but <strong>accessibility</strong>.</p>\n<h3>5. <strong>Balancing Work &amp; Quality of Life</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite his jam-packed schedule, he\u2019s intentional about downtime, family, and personal development. He believes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cA clear mind builds better products.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>In today\u2019s hustle culture, this was a refreshing \u2014 and much-needed \u2014 reminder.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>\u00a0What Stood Out the Most</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve known Harshal Sir for over 15 years. If there\u2019s one consistent quality in him, it\u2019s his ability to <strong>simplify complex problems using relatable, real-world analogies</strong>.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t build for hype. He builds for <strong>impact</strong>.</p>\n<p>His journey \u2014 from services to SaaS, from founder to PhD scholar \u2014 shows that learning never stops, and neither does <strong>purpose-driven innovation</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why This Conversation Matters</h2>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t just a podcast episode. It was a deep look at how:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ideas are born from <strong>observation</strong></li>\n<li>Execution comes from <strong>discipline</strong></li>\n<li>Growth comes from <strong>courage</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And most importantly, how staying <strong>curious</strong> and <strong>humble</strong> can take you much further than just chasing trends.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>\u00a0Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Founder Stories isn\u2019t just about documenting success \u2014 it\u2019s about learning from journeys like Harshal Sir\u2019s that <strong>break the mold</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re building a startup, dreaming of your own SaaS product, or wondering how to lead with both brain and heart, this conversation is your playbook.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned \u2014 more fearless founders coming soon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udca1 Want to be featured on Founder Stories?</strong><br />\nDrop us a message or DM \u201cFounder\u201d \u2014 let\u2019s amplify your story.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

With over 1 million active users annually, Zybra is proving that with patience, grit, and clarity, Indian SaaS startups can play on a global field. And Vishal?

You\u2019re building a system, not chasing virality.\u201dThat hit hard. Especially in a world where founders are often glorified for exits rather</div>\r\n<div>\u00a0than endurance.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h5>2. You Don\u2019t Need to Fear the Big Guys</h5>\r\nXero. Tally. Global giants. And yet, Zybra carved its space. How? \u201cBe obsessed with solving a specific user\u2019s problem better than anyone else,\u201d Vishal shared. Competing with giants isn\u2019t about matching features. It\u2019s about understanding users deeply and delivering clarity.\r\n<h5>3. Validate Before You Build</h5>\r\nThis was gold: \u201cDon\u2019t fall in love with your idea. Fall in love with your user\u2019s pain.\u201d Before Zybra even built the product, they validated the market need, refined use cases, and fine-tuned their pitch \u2014 all before writing thousands of lines of code.\r\n<h5>4. High-Touch Beats High-Tech (Initially)</h5>\r\nIn an era of automated demos and self-serve onboarding, Zybra did the opposite. They grew by meeting clients one-on-one, demoing their tool, answering questions, and building trust. Old-school? Maybe. Effective? 100%.\r\n<h5>5. Stay Lean, Stay Disciplined</h5>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t chase growth at any cost,\u201d Vishal warned. While most startups burn cash chasing vanity metrics, Zybra focused on being lean, sustainable, and profitable. It\u2019s not sexy, but it\u2019s smart.\r\n<h5>6. Funding Is a Strategy, Not a Lifeline</h5>\r\nBootstrapped? Funded? Both? Vishal broke down the pros and cons of each stage and reminded us that raising money isn\u2019t the goal. Solving real problems profitably is. The rest follows.\r\n\r\n</div>"

Thanks, Vishal, for being the kind of founder who lifts others while climbing. Your story, honesty, and lessons are going to stay with us and hopefully inspire many more.
