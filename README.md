# Founder Stories

Founder Stories is a content and community platform that shares authentic journeys of entrepreneurs, innovators, and visionaries. The website highlights the people behind the companies — their struggles, learnings, and breakthroughs — to inspire the next generation of founders. Built with React and integrated with WordPress (via REST API), the platform delivers dynamic, scalable, and high-performance storytelling experiences.
